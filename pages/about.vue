    <h4>Hi, I am Stavros.</h4>

    <br>
    <p>In the spring of 2009, during my second year at University of Crete, I took a web design course
      where we were assigned the task of building both the Frontend and the Backend of an e-shop. Thus began my love
      affair with web development. After Erasmus studies, graduating and serving in the army (obligatory), I relocated
      in Berlin and been living here for the last {{calcTimeInBerlin}}.
    </p>
    <p>At first I was working full time for
      <a href="https://antoni.de/" target="_blank">antoni GmbH.</a> as a Frontend developer. While I still enjoyed it,
      I decided to move on to to face new challenges. Right now I am working at
      <a href="https://www.sparwelt.de/" target="_blank">Sparwelt GmbH</a> (ein Unternehmen der Mediengruppe RTL
      Deutschland) as Frondend developer.</p>

    <p>I love developing performable websites using state of art technologies, focusing on web performance, minimalism
      and user experience.</p>

    <p>When I am not coding, I spend my time playing the guitar, climbing mountains, travelling and ...cooking!</p>
